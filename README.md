A cool little interactive script for people who want to just want to set up the core of the average desktop, nothing else.

```su``` to enter super user, Important, or else a lot of desktops won't install, do ```ee /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf``` and at line 10, change the ending from ```/quarterly``` to ```/latest```. To leave the text editor, press ESC once, a once, then a again. ```git clone https://github.com/coolerguy71/FreeBSD-SetupScript.git``` to clone the repo, ```cd FreeBSD-SetupScript``` to enter the project, and ```chmod +x setup.sh``` to make it executable, and ```./setup.sh``` to start it. Cheers.
