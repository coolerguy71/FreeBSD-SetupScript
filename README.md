A cool little interactive script for people who want to just want to set up the core of the average desktop, nothing else.

```su``` to enter super user, ```fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coolerguy71/FreeBSD-SetupScript/main/setup.sh``` to obtain the script, and ```chmod +x setup.sh``` to make it executable, and ```./setup.sh``` to start it. Cheers.
